TBelief_Destination_Station: it is used to define the belief for a Dastination Station in a Functional Goal

Prediate: Visited Station:
Stations - visited - array of station

Funtion_To_Invoke by agent:
GO_TO_Route							Enter in a route
GO_TO_Step							Move to next step in a route or move to next station from a route
See Route Status					Stimulus: Agent wants to open its virtual camera it is the ionvoked Function from "See Semaphore for Route Status"
Ask_Closed_Route_Duration			Stimulus: Agent wants ask to TCS ask how long the route is closed


Answers from TCS:
invoked Funcionions: 					Answer from TCS or User
GO_TO_Route								Correct move!			(TCS)
GO_TO_Step								Correct move!			(TCS)
See Route Status						Acquired Route Status	(USER)
How long will the route be closed?





Stimuli:
See Semaphore for Route Status		it is Arised when the agent doesn't know the route status (route status = TType_Route_Status.Unknown
									and it generates the "See Route Status" using Belief "Stimulus_Route_Status"
Ask how long the route is closed	It is arised when the agent knows that a route status is red
									and it generates the "Ask_Closed_Route_Duration" using Belief "Stimulus_Closed_Route"


Every time we want insert a type of stymulus, we have to handle following functions:
TExecutive_Resource_Allocation.Information_Selection
TExecutive_Switching_Function.Apply_Filter

This is the prototype of a novel agent architecture, called CARA (Conscious Agent Reasoning Architecture),  that expands Bratman's Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) paradigm by incorporating functions related to consciousness.  Specifically, it implements Baars' Global Workspace Theory, linking it to a realization of Buehler's attention modulation mechanism.  The agent's brain functionalities are structured based on Buehler's Executive Functions theory.
